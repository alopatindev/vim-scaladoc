*scaladoc.txt*  Plugin for searching scaladocs by keyword.

OVERVIEW                                                             *scaladoc*

The vim-scaladoc plug-in allows you to open scaladoc documentation in your
favorite browser based on keyword selection. By default the plugin will
search the following locations for documentation:

  - Official Scala Site [http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current]
  - Local Project (target/scala-x.x.x/api)
  - User Specified Paths

The local project search is based on the current open file in VIM. If the file
contains a 'src' directory in its path, then `target/scala-x.x.x/api` is
appended to the parent of this directory and added to the search path.

COMMANDS                                                    *scaladoc-commands*

There is only one command '|:ScalaDoc|'. This command should be followed by one
or more keywords. For example:

    :ScalaDoc list

    http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/immutable/List.html

    :ScalaDoc mu queue

    http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/mutable/Queue.html

    :ScalaDoc im queue

    http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/immutable/Queue.html

If multiple matches are found (e.g. ':ScalaDoc queue'), then a read-only
window will be opened to select a URL from.

Note: The first time |`:ScalaDoc| is run it may be a bit slow as it downloads
and indexes the docs, but subsequent runs should be fast.

MAPPINGS                                                     *scaladoc-mappigs*

There are no built-in mappings added for scaladoc, but it is simple enough to
add your own. For example:

    nnoremap <F1> :call ScalaDoc(expand("<cword>"))<CR>

CUSTOMIZING                                              *scaladoc-customizing*

A few variables are available to customize settings:

    *g:scaladoc*            :  Enable (1) / Disable (0) plugin
                             (Default: 1)
    *g:scaladoc_cache_dir*  :  Directory to store index caches in
                             (Default: `tmp` dir of install directory)
    *g:scaladoc_cache_ttl*  :  TTL (days) for cached indexes
                             (Default: 15 days)
    *g:scaladoc_paths*      :  Additional paths (comma sep) to search in
                             (Default: '')

Note: The TTL applies to the official scaladoc site and to general cache
cleanup. Local API files are checked for modifications each time |:ScalaDoc| is
run in order to pickup changes from a local build.
